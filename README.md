# Intermediate Project Ideas

This is a list of projects that someone who has a good knowledge of a programming language basics may do as a practice to improve their knowledge of the language. The projects are language agnostic and the project descriptions are general enough to leave potential implementers freedom to implement projects as they see fit. Contributions to the list are welcome.



#### System utilities

- Write a program that displays basic computer information (processor, memory, disks etc). You can use a GUI or CLI.
- Write a program that lists all active processes with their memory usage.
- Write a GUI program that lists installed services/daemons and is able to start/stop/restart each (advanced).
- Write a GUI program that periodically displays computer total memory and processor usage.



#### Image processing

- Create a captcha library
- Create a library for adding watermarks to images. The library should have options to add both text and image watermarks.
- Create a library to generate animated gifs from video clips.



#### Simulation

- Create a Conway's game of life simulation
- Create a simulation of [bird of fish flocking behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)) (advanced)
- Implement a basic [Ant colony optimization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms) (advanced)
- Create a simple [Predator-prey simulation](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Predator-prey_model)



#### Games

- Create a generic game loop with 60 FPS as a goal.
- Create a Snake clone.
- Create a Space Invaders clone
- Create a Tetris clone
- Create a Mastermind clone
